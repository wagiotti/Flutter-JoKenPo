## Getting Started

This little game is the second exercise in the mobile application development course, which I am doing at Udemy.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Course: With Jamilton Damasceno](https://www.udemy.com/course/desenvolvimento-android-e-ios-com-flutter/learn/lecture/14983912#overview)

For help on starting Flutter, see the official documentation,
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
